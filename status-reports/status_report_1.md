- Made a **Discord server** and **iMessage/RCS** group chat with all 7 of us.  
- Made a **Google Sheets** tracking the cost of the parts we need.  
- Made a **Google Doc** to jot down project goals; includes our **need/problem/goal** statement.  
- We spoke with our TA on Monday as a group and got feedback/instructions.  
- We figured out our schedule concerning when we’ll all meet to work on the project. Also agreed on times for TA and Instructor meetings.
