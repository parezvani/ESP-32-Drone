- **Matin**:
    - Made drone_design_2 but decided as a group it wouldn't work and was a bad design.
    - Made drone_design_5 in Onshape and [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org).
    - Improved upon drone_design_5 based on group feedback.
        - Thinner, lighter, and longer motor arms.
- **Nick**:
    - Made bill_of_materials_v5 to update and include perforated circuit boards and fmeale header pins.
    - Picked up perforated circuit boards and female header pins from BELS.
    - Working with Kenny on ciruit design.
