- **Kenny**:
    - Picked up a blank circuit board to take measurements and place the drawing model on top of the CAD model the CAD team designed
    - Finalized the circuitry componenets neccessary to build the drone
    - Working on the circuit diagram to wire everything together
- **Kevin**:
    - Made drone_design_1 in Onshape.
    - 3D Printed drone_design_1 and drone_design_5.
        - Ran into problems setting up 3D Printer.
        - Printer air printing and had to adjust filament stuck near nozzle.
    - Compared printed designs for sizing and dimensions of parts.
- **Matin**:
    - Made drone_design_2 but decided as a group it wouldn't work and was a bad design.
    - Made drone_design_5 in Onshape and [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org).
    - Improved upon drone_design_5 based on group feedback.
        - Thinner, lighter, and longer motor arms.
- **Nick**:
    - Made bill_of_materials_v5 to update and include perforated circuit boards and fmeale header pins.
    - Picked up perforated circuit boards and female header pins from BELS.
    - Working with Kenny on ciruit design.
- **Parsa**:
    - Organized Trello Board, to see what everyone will be working on
    - Worked on the ESP-IDF files to import to main Branch
    - Planned our next steps on what we will be working on to stay on track
    - Help review part diagram to see what connections we'll need to connect all the parts of the system
