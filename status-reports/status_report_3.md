# Status Report 3

## Achievements from before:
- Finished Material list
- Finalized our CAD design

## Setbacks from before:
- Delivery of the materials might take too long to arrive

## Who Did What:
- **Christian**:
    - Imported ESP-IDF files to main branch
    - Picked up female pins and blank circuit for measurements and design from BELS
    - Worked on part decision and testing simulation on ensuring drone flight
    - Helped review 3D printed designs providing feedback and testing durability
- **Kenny**:
    - Picked up a blank circuit board to take measurements and place the drawing model on top of the CAD model the CAD team designed
    - Finalized the circuitry components necessary to build the drone
    - Working on the circuit diagram to wire everything together
- **Kevin**:
    - Made drone_design_1 in Onshape.
    - 3D Printed drone_design_1 and drone_design_5.
        - Ran into problems setting up 3D Printer.
        - Printer air printing and had to adjust filament stuck near nozzle.
    - Compared printed designs for sizing and dimensions of parts.
- **Matin**:
    - Made drone_design_2 but decided as a group it wouldn't work and was a bad design.
    - Made drone_design_5 in Onshape and [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org).
    - Improved upon drone_design_5 based on group feedback.
        - Thinner, lighter, and longer motor arms.
    - Agreed upon drone name "SpecterFLY".
- **Nick**:
    - Made bill_of_materials_v4 to update and include perforated circuit boards and female header pins.
    - Picked up perforated circuit boards and female header pins from BELS.
    - Working with Kenny on circuit design.
        - Started Experimenting with layout of header pins + esp32c3 board
    - Improved timeline organization on Trello Board.
- **Parsa**:
    - Organized Trello Board, to see what everyone will be working on
    - Worked on the ESP-IDF files to import to main Branch
    - Planned our next steps on what we will be working on to stay on track
    - Help review part diagram to see what connections we'll need to connect all the parts of the system

- **Ryan**:
    - Finished the Persona documents
    - Made and sent the Bill of Materials to Bells and Professor Harrison
    - Sent follow up email to get approval

## To-do, In-progress, Done:
- **To-do**:
    - Design a way to implement the circuit to be hot swappable
    - Make the wires as a pin fixture instead of individual wire strands
- **In-progress**:
    - text
- **Done**:
    - Sent in the BOM to BELS

## Toolsets:
- GitHub
- eCalc
- online tutorials
