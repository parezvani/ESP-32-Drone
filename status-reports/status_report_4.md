    - Fixed drone_design_5.
        - Taller frame to account for battery, ESP-32, ESC, etc.
        - Removed motor arm channels intended for wire routing (too small/thin). Will route wires ontop of the arms instead.
        - Added motor-to-frame notches/holes for clean motor wire routing.
        - Fixed motor slot circumference; motors will now fit nicely inside frame.
        - Fixed motor slot holes (for securing motors in place).
