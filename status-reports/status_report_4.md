# Status Report 4

## Achievements from before:
- Updating of needs statement talk about the implmentation of wireless communication with the use of smart phones
- Refining our objective design
- Printed a new body for the frame design
- Got rid of the affordability aspect of our need statement

## Setbacks from before:
- Can not order off Alibaba
- Waiting on parts
- Need to find a new ESC
- FPV Camera Compatability issues with ESP

## Who Did What:
- **Christian**:
    - Researched bluetooth connections to ESP32, necessary PID, SPI for internal communication with IMU
    - Researched possible ESC alternatives for replacement
    - Started coding IMU communication with ESP using SPI
- **Kenny**:
    - Completed the finalized circuit design
    - Researched the ESC component for replacement
- **Kevin**:
    - text
- **Matin**:
    - Fixed drone_design_5.
        - Taller frame to account for battery, ESP-32, ESC, etc.
        - Removed motor arm channels intended for wire routing (too small/thin). Will route wires ontop of the arms instead.
        - Added motor-to-frame notches/holes for clean motor wire routing.
        - Fixed motor slot circumference; motors will now fit nicely inside frame.
        - Fixed motor slot holes (for securing motors in place).
    - 3D printed CAD prototype.
- **Nick**:
    - Created first iteration of design document
    - Drew high-level drone design on lab whiteboard
    - Added circuit-design directory and uploaded first design
    - Started work on server communication
- **Parsa**:
    - Reveiwed code on which protocol to use for GPIO communications
    - Talked and guided team to figure out our Problem, Need, and Goal statements
    - Looked and found a new ESC for the drone
    - Went to BELS to pickup Motor so we can test code with
- **Ryan**:
    - Reasearch I2C vs SPI difference in drones
    - leanred the basics of the PID for the motors
    - communication with Bels
    - started the PID code

## To-do, In-progress, Done:
- **To-do**:
    - Organize ESP code files
    - Work on the motor to esp connection
- **In-progress**:
    - PCB Prototype
    - Finalize CAD Design Prototype
    - CAD Dimensions
    - Finish up Problem, Need, and Goal statements
- **Done**:
    - 3D Print CAD Design Prototypes
    - Ordered Most parts
