# Notes

## Sizing/ Mesasurements
- Talked about wing to wing dimensions, so it would be 127mm by 127mm from each wing span
- Measured the esc module and where it would go in the box
- Talked about if its better strapping the battery on the bottom of the housing, and possibly adding landing mounts to protect battery from landing
- Also mentioned if we still need wing protectors, might add that in for next quarter

## Optimizing Modularity
- Implement pass through connectors to implement a receiver system where we can plug and play with sensor
- Using the pass through connectors we have permanant soldered pins so user can just plug sensor into the pass through connectors

## General
- got caught up on meeting with the professor
- Talked about the perforated board
