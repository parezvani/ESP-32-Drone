Prototype vs High Level Design:

* Make a small part of high level design functional, not full design  
* Need and Goal Statement  
* Not sufficient for a 123 Project?  
* Audience Spectrum  
  * Can google and code  
  * Can’t code  
  * **Make it specific**  
* **“Pricing”**  
  * Open source then copy  
  * Can be dodgy  
* Not designing prototype  
* Flying instructions:  
  * How high the drone is  
  * Stationary flying  
  * Flying 3 meters forward then back  

Need/Goal:

* There can already be a product like our design  
* What is the need ex:  
  * Smart Vending Machine  
  * Tells you what you buy and if it’s healthy etc  
* Fix this  
* Build around need  
* 

Prototype:

* Implement some parts that work to showcase how to make high level  
* Document meant for another team of engineers  
* Functional parts:  
  * Send communication between devices  
  * If one motor can spin from communication then proves for four  
* Focus on the functional portions for now
