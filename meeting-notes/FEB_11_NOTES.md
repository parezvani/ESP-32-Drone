# Notes

## Sizing / Measurements
- Talked about wing to wing dimensions, so it would be 127mm by 127mm from each wing span
- Measured the esc module and where it would go in the box
- Talked about if its better strapping the battery on the bottom of the housing, and possibly adding landing mounts to protect battery from landing
- Also mentioned if we still need wing protectors, might add that in for next quarter

## Optimizing Modularity
- Implement pass through connectors to implement a receiver system where we can plug and play with sensor
- Using the pass through connectors we have permanent soldered pins so user can just plug sensor into the pass through connectors

## General
- got caught up on meeting with the professor
- Talked about the perforated board

## Concerns
- Timing on when the parts would arrive, if there's any delays we would need to communicated with BELS to get some sort of expedited shipping on the main materials we need
