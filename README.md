# ESP-32-Drone (SpectreFLY)

SpectreFLY is a student-built drone platform centered on the `ESP32-C3-DevKit-RUST-1`, with swappable payload ideas (camera/LiDAR) and iterative frame + circuit prototyping.

## Repository Layout
- `esp/`: firmware and embedded code (main implementation area).
- `drone-designs/`: CAD assets, frame dimensions, and `drone_design_5.scad` OpenSCAD model.
- `circuit-design/`: circuit wiring photos/diagrams.
- `bill-of-materials/`: BoM revisions (`v1` to `v4`) with part options and pricing.
- `design-document/`: LaTeX design document drafts (`v1`, `v2`).
- `status-reports/` and `meeting-notes/`: project progress history and decisions.
